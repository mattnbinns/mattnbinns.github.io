# Learning Markdown
## Basic Syntax
### Headings
Headings are created using the number sign (#). Just like how we used headings and sub-headings,the same context and rules apply when using headings in Markdown. Each number of number signs(#) is associated with what level heading you are using. For example a main header would be represented by one number sign (#) whereas, a sub-heading of the main header may be represented by two number signs (##). 

**Key Note:** Ensure that there is a space between the number sign (#) and the text. 
### Paragraphs
To create a paragraph in markdown, simply use one or more blank lines between the lines of text. 

**Key Note:** It is important to note that you **DO NOT** indent your paragraphs with a space or using the tab key. 
### Line Breaks
To create a line break or new line, there are two options:

1. Use two or more space, then hit enter or return on your keyboard.
2. Use HTML element tag < br >

**Key Note:** The < br > element tag can **ONLY** be used if your Markdown application supports HTML. 
### Bolding Text
To bold your text in Markdown, you may either use two astrisks  ( ** ) before and after the word or phrase without any spaces. Or you can use the underscore sign ( _ ) before and after the word of phrase without any spaces. 

**Key Note:** If you want bold a text that happens to be in the middle, use astrisks **NOT** underscores.

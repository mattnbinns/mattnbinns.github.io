# Learning Markdown
## Basic Syntax
### Headings
Headings are created using the number sign (#). Just like how we used headings and sub-headings,the same context and rules apply when using headings in Markdown. Each number of number signs(#) is associated with what level heading you are using. For example a main header would be represented by one number sign (#) whereas, a sub-heading of the main header may be represented by two number signs (##). 

**Key Note:** Ensure that there is a space between the number sign (#) and the text. 
### Paragraphs
To create a paragraph in markdown, simply use one or more blank lines between the lines of text. 
**Key Note:** It is important to note that you **DO NOT** indent your paragraphs with a space or using the tab key.

# Learning Markdown
## Basic Syntax
### Headings
Headings are created using the number sign (#). Just like how we used headings and sub-headings,the same context and rules apply when using headings in Markdown. Each number of number signs(#) is associated with what level heading you are using. For example a main header would be represented by one number sign (#) whereas, a sub-heading of the main header may be represented by two number signs (##). 

**Key Note:** Ensure that there is a space between the number sign (#) and the text. 
### Paragraphs
To create a paragraph in markdown, simply use one or more blank lines between the lines of text. 

**Key Note:** It is important to note that you **DO NOT** indent your paragraphs with a space or using the tab key. 
### Line Breaks
To create a line break or new line, there are two options:

1. Use two or more space, then hit enter or return on your keyboard.
2. Use HTML element tag < br >

**Key Note:** The < br > element tag can **ONLY** be used if your Markdown application supports HTML. 
### Bolding Text
To bold your text in Markdown, you may either use two astrisks  ( ** ) before and after the word or phrase without any spaces. Or you can use the underscore sign ( _ ) before and after the word of phrase without any spaces. 

**Key Note:** If you want bold a text that happens to be in the middle, use astrisks **NOT** underscores.  
### Italicizing Text
To italicize text add **ONLY** one astrisk **OR** underscore before and after a word. 

**Key Note:** If you want to italicize a text that happens to be in the middle, use an astrisk **NOT** a underscore.
#### What If I Want To Italicize And Bold My Text?
So what happens when you want to both italicize and bold your text? What do you do? To italicize and bold your text you **MUST** use three astrisks before and after the word. If you want this to be done a word in the middle, the same rule would apply. 
### Blockquotes
> To create a blockquote like this, simply add a ( > ) sign in front of the paragraph. If there are multiple paragraphs, then add a ( > ) in front of all
> paragraphs and blank lines.
>> Blockquotes can also be nested together like this. To do this add ( >> ) in front of the paragraph.

# Learning Markdown
## Basic Syntax
### Headings
Headings are created using the number sign (#). Just like how we used headings and sub-headings,the same context and rules apply when using headings in Markdown. Each number of number signs(#) is associated with what level heading you are using. For example a main header would be represented by one number sign (#) whereas, a sub-heading of the main header may be represented by two number signs (##). 

**Key Note:** Ensure that there is a space between the number sign and the text.

## Basic Syntax

### Headings

Headings are created using the number sign (#). Just like how we used headings and sub-headings,the same context and rules apply when using headings in Markdown. Each number of number signs(#) is associated with what level heading you are using. For example a main header would be represented by one number sign (#) whereas, a sub-heading of the main header may be represented by two number signs (##).

**Key Note:** Ensure that there is a space between the number sign (#) and the text.

### Paragraphs

To create a paragraph in markdown, simply use one or more blank lines between the lines of text.

**Key Note:** It is important to note that you **DO NOT** indent your paragraphs with a space or using the tab key.

### Line Breaks

To create a line break or new line, there are two options:

1. Use two or more space, then hit enter or return on your keyboard.
2. Use HTML element tag < br >

**Key Note:** The < br > element tag can **ONLY** be used if your Markdown application supports HTML.

### Bolding Text

To bold your text in Markdown, you may either use two astrisks  ( ** ) before and after the word or phrase without any spaces. Or you can use the underscore sign ( _ ) before and after the word of phrase without any spaces.

**Key Note:** If you want bold a text that happens to be in the middle, use astrisks **NOT** underscores.  

### Italicizing Text

To italicize text add **ONLY** one astrisk **OR** underscore before and after a word.

**Key Note:** If you want to italicize a text that happens to be in the middle, use an astrisk **NOT** a underscore.

#### What If I Want To Italicize And Bold My Text?

So what happens when you want to both italicize and bold your text? What do you do? To italicize and bold your text you **MUST** use three astrisks before and after the word. If you want this to be done a word in the middle, the same rule would apply.

### Blockquotes

> To create a blockquote like this, simply add a ( > ) sign in front of the paragraph. If there are multiple paragraphs, then add a ( > ) in front of all
> paragraphs and blank lines.
>> Blockquotes can also be nested together like this. To do this add ( >> ) in front of the paragraph.

### Lists

#### Ordered List

An order list, is a list organize in a numeric fashion. To start, add lines with numbers follow by a period.

**Key Note:** The numbers **DO NOT** have to be in numerical order **BUT** the list should start with number one.

#### Undordered List

An unordered list is the opposite of an ordered list and it is organized in bullet point format. To start, add lines with dashes, astrisks, or plus signs.

#### Task List

To create a task list that can be checked, begin each list item with a dash followed by brackets ( [ ] ). To mark a task complete type [ x ].

**Key Note:** If you would like to nest items within a list simply add a indent.

### Horizontal Rule

A horizontal rule is essentially a horizontal line going across the screen of a page. To create a horizontal rule, use three or more astricks, dashes, or underscores on a line by themselves.

### Links

To create a link, type in the title you would like the link to be labeled inside brackets. Include the URL link inside parentheses following right after the closing brackets.

**Key Note** If the URL link has any spaces in the middle, replace the space with %20.

### Images

To add a image in Markup, start with a exclamation mark ( ! ) followed by an alternative text in brackets. Alternative text will only be displayed in the case your image doesn't display on your site. After typing in the alt text, include the URL in parentheses.

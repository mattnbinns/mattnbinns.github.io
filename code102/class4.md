## Wireframe and Design

### What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a skectch of a digital interface. Imagine it like how you would have a blueprint for how a house is going to be built. Wireframing would be that blueprint for that digital design, for example, like a website. Wireframing provides the designer a quick glimpse of the basic structures of how to the design should look before going into the detailed process of building it.

### Types of Wireframing

#### **Sketch Wireframing**

This process of wireframing is done simply by using a pen and a sheet of paper.

#### **Digital Wireframing**

This process of wireframing is done using a variety of tools that offer unique features that could be beneficial to your design project.

**Key Note:** It is important to note to try to **keep things simple** and to **AVOID** going into great detail, this is **NOT** what wireframing is for.

## HTML Basics

HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is the code used to stucture the basic contents of a web page. It consisit of elements and tags, all of which, can make your content appear a certain way.

### Elements

An element consist of an opening tag and a closing tag represented by a angle bracket. The link below provides a list of various HTML elements and a short description of what they are used for.

[HTML Element Reference Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

### Attributes

Attributes contain extra information about an element. **ALL** attribute will have the following:

* A space between it and the element
* Name of the attribute followed by an equal sign
* Attribute value wrapped in quotation marks

### Nesting

Nesting is the practice of putting an element inside another element.

### HTML Skeleton aka "Boilerplate"

This is a standardized markup that needs to be in every document you create:

1. **!DOCTYPE html** ( Indicates to the browser which version to expect )

2. **html** ( Represents the entire top level of the document )

3. **head** ( The head contains information that **WILL NOT** be displayed on the webpage like:  title, scripts, style sheets, etc.

4. **body** ( The body represents the content of an HTML document. There con **ONLY** be one body element.

**Key Note:** html **MUST** have one head and one body

## Semantics

Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code. For example, "what role does a HTML element have?". The link below provide a list of some HTML semantics:
